From 2020 onward, a strong rise in space waste mass influx to the atmosphere can be seen. Future scenarios discussed by Schulz & Glassmeier (2021) may already be reached by the end of 2025. In 2024, 24 elements were dominating the meteoric injection compared to 18 in 2015. Several of them are transition metals, which are known for their catalytic activity. This indicates a substantial risk of long-term adverse effects on the atmosphere such as ozone depletion, radiative effects and changes in cloud formation, if no action is taken. Research is urgently needed into the atmospheric accumulation, chemistry, and general atmospheric effects of specific elements.",

DeepSeek-OCR consists of two components: Deep Encoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder. Specifically, DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a compression ratio < 10x), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of 97%. Even at a compression ratio of 20x, the OCR accuracy still remains at about 60%. This shows considerable promise for research areas such as historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs. Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value.\nOn OmniDoBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 (6000+ tokens per page on average) while utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens.

And every major commercial social network is complicit. They’re collaborators.  We all know about Twitter acquirer Elon Musk, who bent the platform to fit his political worldview. But he’s not alone.\nHere’s Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, owner of LinkedIn, who contributed a million dollars to Trump’s inauguration fund.\nHere’s Mark Zuckerberg, who owns Threads, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, who said that he feels optimistic about the new administration’s agenda. And here’s Larry Ellison, who will control TikTok in the US, who was a major investor in Trump, and who one advisor called, in a WIRED interview, the shadow President of the United States. Social media is very quickly becoming aligned with a state that in itself is becoming increasingly authoritarian.</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Tags:</strong> ethics, social-media, open-social</p>",
