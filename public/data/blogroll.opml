Supporters of more-stringent AI regulations launched their own effort this week, aiming to raise at least $50 million to help candidates who support more AI regulation.
The biggest player so far is Leading the Future, a super PAC that has said it would use donations of more than $100 million to “reshape the political environment around innovation policy.” The group has vowed to support candidates of both parties who mirror the industry’s priorities and “aggressively oppose” those who jeopardize them.

It also raised doubts over the billions of dollars being spent to build the data centres needed to operate powerful models. ----- China has overtaken the US in the global market for “open” artificial intelligence models, gaining a crucial edge over how the powerful technology is used around the world. A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and open-source AI start-up Hugging Face found that the total share of downloads of new Chinese-made open models rose to 17 per cent in the past year. The figure surpasses the 15.8 per cent share of downloads from American developers such as Google, Meta and OpenAI — the first time Chinese groups have beaten their American counterparts. Open models — which are free to download, modify and integrate by developers — make it easier for start-ups to create products and researchers to improve them. Widespread adoption will confer outsized influence over AI’s future.

Most organizations are still in the experimentation or piloting phase: Nearly two-thirds of respondents say their organizations have not yet begun scaling AI across the enterprise.

High curiosity in AI agents: Sixty-two percent of survey respondents say their organizations are at least experimenting with AI agents.

Positive leading indicators on impact of AI: Respondents report use-case-level cost and revenue benefits, and 64 percent say that AI is enabling their innovation. However, just 39 percent report EBIT impact at the enterprise level.

High performers use AI to drive growth, innovation, and cost: Eighty percent of respondents say their companies set efficiency as an objective of their AI initiatives, but the companies seeing the most value from AI often set growth or innovation as additional objectives." created="Tue, 09 Dec 2025 12:14:50 GMT" category="mckinsey,agents,report" />

Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows." created="Fri, 28 Nov 2025 11:22:29 GMT" category="video,performance,optimization,qwen,ai,cn" />

They are technology neutral and apply to all AI technologies as they become available.

The principles apply across all areas of CERN’s activities, including:

AI for scientific and technical research: data analysis, anomaly detection, simulation, predictive maintenance and optimisation of accelerator performance or detector operations, and
AI for productivity and administrative use: document drafting, note taking, automated translation, language correction and enhancement, coding assistants, and workflow automation.

A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and open-source AI start-up Hugging Face found that the total share of downloads of new Chinese-made open models rose to 17 per cent in the past year. The figure surpasses the 15.8 per cent share of downloads from American developers such as Google, Meta and OpenAI — the first time Chinese groups have beaten their American counterparts.

We are excited to introduce Grok 4.1, which brings significant improvements to the real-world usability of Grok. Our 4.1 model is exceptionally capable in creative, emotional, and collaborative interactions. It is more perceptive to nuanced intent, compelling to speak with, and coherent in personality, while fully retaining the razor-sharp intelligence and reliability of its predecessors. To achieve this, we used the same large scale reinforcement learning infrastructure that powered Grok 4 and applied it to optimize the style, personality, helpfulness, and alignment of the model. In order to optimize these non-verifiable reward signals, we developed new methods that let us use frontier agentic reasoning models as reward models to autonomously evaluate and iterate on responses at scale

Much like a choreographer, they direct the feeling and intent of the final movement, rather than moving each leg themselves.

“Introducing new procedural tools requires acceptance and a change of mindset.”

In this new workflow, our colleagues have to work at a higher level of abstraction: instead of deciding animation curves, they describe movement behaviors that the machine learning should respect. Similarly, our game designers aren’t able to decide exact movements for an agent.

They are now integral to workflows, applications, and agentic systems, transforming how information is generated, mediated, and consumed.

The past year catalyzed a step change in how the field conceives reasoning. The emergence of o1-class models normalized extended deliberation and tool use, shifting evaluation beyond single-shot benchmarks toward process-based metrics, latency-cost tradeoffs, and success-on-task under orchestration. Reasoning has become a measure of how effectively models can plan and verify to deliver more reliable outcomes.

The data show that the LLM ecosystem is structurally plural. No single model or provider dominates; instead, users select systems along multiple axes such as capability, latency, price, and trust depending on context. This heterogeneity is not a transient phase but a fundamental property of the market. It promotes rapid iteration and reduces systemic dependence on any one model or stack.

Laws by states could cause the loss of federal funding, by its design and emphasis on &quot;truthful outputs&quot; and opposition to laws requiring models to &quot;alter their truthful outputs&quot; suggests resistance to certain bias mitigation requirements. This could influence how companies approach fairness interventions in their models.  //


(4) That evaluation of State AI laws shall, at a minimum, identify laws that require AI models to alter their truthful outputs, or that may compel AI developers or deployers to disclose or report information in a manner that would violate the First Amendment or any other provision of the Constitution.  The evaluation may additionally identify State laws that promote AI innovation consistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order.

(7) &quot;That policy statement must explain the circumstances under which State laws that require alterations to the truthful outputs of AI models are preempted by the Federal Trade Commission Act&apos;s prohibition on engaging in deceptive acts or practices affecting commerce.&quot;

The setup for this framing appears here:

(1) &quot;State laws are increasingly responsible for requiring entities to embed ideological bias within models. For example, a new Colorado law banning &apos;algorithmic discrimination&apos; may even force AI models to produce false results in order to avoid a &apos;differential treatment or impact&apos; on protected groups.&quot;" created="Fri, 12 Dec 2025 12:11:11 GMT" category="ai,fact,truth,states-rights,regulation,crytpto" />

Implemented responsibly, pay-to-crawl could represent a way for websites to sustain the creation and sharing of their content, and manage substitutive uses, keeping content publicly accessible where it might otherwise not be shared or would disappear behind even more restrictive paywalls.

However, we do have significant reservations.

Pay-to-crawl may represent an appropriate strategy for independent websites seeking to prevent AI crawlers from knocking them offline or to generate supplementary revenue. But elsewhere, pay-to-crawl systems could be cynically exploited by rightsholders to generate excessive profits, at the expense of human access and without necessarily benefiting the original creators.

In March 2020 George Kamiya of the International Energy Agency estimated that &quot;streaming a Netflix video in 2019 typically consumed 0.12-0.24kWh of electricity per hour&quot; - that&apos;s 240 watt-hours per Netflix hour at the higher end.

Assuming that higher end, a ChatGPT prompt by Sam Altman&apos;s estimate uses:

0.34 Wh / (240 Wh / 3600 seconds) = 5.1 seconds of Netflix

Or double that, 10.2 seconds, if you take the lower end of the Netflix estimate instead.

I&apos;m always interested in anything that can help contextualize a number like &quot;0.34 watt-hours&quot; - I think this comparison to Netflix is a neat way of doing that.

This is evidently not the whole story with regards to AI energy usage - training costs, data center buildout costs and the ongoing fierce competition between the providers all add up to a very significant carbon footprint for the AI industry as a whole." created="Mon, 01 Dec 2025 13:54:43 GMT" category="netflix,environment,chatgpt,analysis" />

For example, it might detect a relationship between ‘wind’ and ‘answer’ in ‘Blowin’ in the Wind’ (1962), or between ‘joker’ and ‘thief’ in ‘All Along the Watchtower’ (1967).

The biggest player so far is Leading the Future, a super PAC that has said it would use donations of more than $100 million to “reshape the political environment around innovation policy.” The group has vowed to support candidates of both parties who mirror the industry’s priorities and “aggressively oppose” those who jeopardize them.

I posit there are &quot;4 P&apos;s&quot; needed for any collective knowledge system to be robust and accurate: permanence, provenance, permission and placement. If these properties exist throughout our knowledge graph, we can make robust networks for rapid evidence-based decision making. They also form a dam against the wave of agentic AI that is going to dominate the Internet next year in a big way.

Will building these collective knowledge systems be a transformative capability for human society? Hot on the heels of COP30 concluding indecisively, I&apos;ve been getting excited by decision making towards biodiversity going down a more positive path in IPBES. We could empower decisionmakers at all scales (local, country, international) to be able to move five times faster on actions about global species extinctions, unsustainable wildlife trade and food security, while rapidly assimilating extraordinarily complex evidence chains. I&apos;ll talk about this more while explaining the principles...

This post is split up into a few parts. First, let&apos;s introduce ARIA&apos;s convening role in this. Then I&apos;ll introduce the principles of permanence, provenance, permission, and placement. The post does assume some knowledge of Internet protocols; I&apos;ll write a more accessible one for a general audience at a future date when the ideas are more baked!" created="Thu, 11 Dec 2025 23:36:37 GMT" category="knowledge,knowlege-graph,knowledge-system,aria,permanence, provenance, permission, placement" />

To compete and deter in a two-rival space environment, the U.S. Space Force (USSF) should
adopt a more proactive approach and match resilience efforts with investments in counterspace capabilities that would enable the United States to apply a deterrence-by-punishment
approach in space. Such an approach would suggest developing, exercising, and selectively
revealing space weapons. Leveraging these weapons would enable deterrence-by-punishment options and support cost imposition during both peacetime and conflict. Ultimately,

Rather than compressing information like a black box, these models function as reversible encoders, preserving the full structure of their inputs from initialization through training. 

The implications for safety and privacy are equally significant: injectivity allows for activation-based anomaly detection to defend against adversarial attacks, but it also raises concerns about data recovery and intellectual property, since original prompts could potentially be extracted. As a result, new approaches—such as deliberately “forgetful” architectures or blockchain-style provenance tracking—may be needed to protect sensitive information. Overall, this discovery reframes language models as verifiable and interpretable systems, offering new trust and accountability in critical domains like law, healthcare, and governance, while demanding fresh ethical and regulatory safeguards." created="Thu, 30 Oct 2025 10:56:01 GMT" category="llms,audit,privacy,ip,legal" />

But hope for me has never been optimism. Optimism is &quot;everything will be fine,&quot; which invites people to kick back and wait for &quot;fine&quot; to arrive of its own accord. Hope for me is always that there are possibilities. And we have a responsibility to try to realize them, and to not realize the worst possibilities. The future is being made in the present. So hope for me is not about prophesying a future that everything will be fine. It&apos;s reminding people that we&apos;ve changed the world before, and that we can again: we know how it works.

Here we study global dynamical patterns of communication on Twitter across many scales. Underlying the observed patterns is both the diurnal rotation of the Earth, day and night, and the synchrony required for contingency of actions between individuals. We find that urban areas show a cyclic contraction and expansion that resembles heartbeats linked to social rather than natural cycles. Different urban areas have characteristic signatures of daily collective activities. We show that the differences detected are consistent with a new emergent global synchrony that couples behaviour in distant regions across the world. Although local synchrony is the major force that shapes the collective behaviour in cities, a larger-scale synchronization is beginning to occur." created="Sat, 18 Oct 2025 14:10:45 GMT" category="human,behavior,patterns,social-media,synchrony" />

They are now integral to workflows, applications, and agentic systems, transforming how information is generated, mediated, and consumed.

The past year catalyzed a step change in how the field conceives reasoning. The emergence of o1-class models normalized extended deliberation and tool use, shifting evaluation beyond single-shot benchmarks toward process-based metrics, latency-cost tradeoffs, and success-on-task under orchestration. Reasoning has become a measure of how effectively models can plan and verify to deliver more reliable outcomes.

The data show that the LLM ecosystem is structurally plural. No single model or provider dominates; instead, users select systems along multiple axes such as capability, latency, price, and trust depending on context. This heterogeneity is not a transient phase but a fundamental property of the market. It promotes rapid iteration and reduces systemic dependence on any one model or stack.

 Life is mostly doing anaerobic respiration until this point, when some guys start making their own sugars and storing them. These guys are tasty. Previously bacteria were too un-nutritious to eat, but photosynthetic organisms are now worth hunting and eating. This kicks off aerobic respiration, which is more efficient.

Animals and fungi, the two multicellular respiratory (in this context, as opposed to photosynthetic) branches of life, chose different paths: fungi wait for sugar-containing life to die and eat through external digestion by secreting enzymes.

Through four experiments with 123 young nonmusicians, integrating eye-tracking, neurophysiological recordings, white matter structural imaging, and behavioral analysis, we reveal a previously unrecognized form of synchronization: spontaneous eye blinks synchronize with musical beats. Blinks robustly synchronized with beats across a range of tempi and independently of melodic cues. Electroencephalogram recordings revealed a dynamic correspondence between blink timing and neural beat tracking. Blink synchronization performance was linked to white matter microstructure variation in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus, a key sensorimotor pathway. Additionally, the strength of blink synchronization reflected the modulation of dynamic auditory attention.

I just set all of these loops running and let them configure in whichever way they wanted to, and in fact the result is very, very nice.

Implemented responsibly, pay-to-crawl could represent a way for websites to sustain the creation and sharing of their content, and manage substitutive uses, keeping content publicly accessible where it might otherwise not be shared or would disappear behind even more restrictive paywalls.

However, we do have significant reservations.

Pay-to-crawl may represent an appropriate strategy for independent websites seeking to prevent AI crawlers from knocking them offline or to generate supplementary revenue. But elsewhere, pay-to-crawl systems could be cynically exploited by rightsholders to generate excessive profits, at the expense of human access and without necessarily benefiting the original creators.

We can build AI that isn&apos;t centralized under the control of a handful of giant companies. Or any other definition of &quot;good AI&quot; that people might aspire to. But instead, we end up with the worst, most anti-social approaches because the platforms that have introduced &quot;AI&quot; to the public imagination are run by authoritarian extremists with deeply destructive agendas.

They are technology neutral and apply to all AI technologies as they become available.

The principles apply across all areas of CERN’s activities, including:

AI for scientific and technical research: data analysis, anomaly detection, simulation, predictive maintenance and optimisation of accelerator performance or detector operations, and
AI for productivity and administrative use: document drafting, note taking, automated translation, language correction and enhancement, coding assistants, and workflow automation.

In March 2020 George Kamiya of the International Energy Agency estimated that &quot;streaming a Netflix video in 2019 typically consumed 0.12-0.24kWh of electricity per hour&quot; - that&apos;s 240 watt-hours per Netflix hour at the higher end.

Assuming that higher end, a ChatGPT prompt by Sam Altman&apos;s estimate uses:

0.34 Wh / (240 Wh / 3600 seconds) = 5.1 seconds of Netflix

Or double that, 10.2 seconds, if you take the lower end of the Netflix estimate instead.

I&apos;m always interested in anything that can help contextualize a number like &quot;0.34 watt-hours&quot; - I think this comparison to Netflix is a neat way of doing that.

I define &quot;intelligence&quot; as being capable of knowing or understanding, at least within some domain. ChatGPT cannot know or understand anything, so it is not intelligence. It does not know what its output means. It has no idea that words can mean anything.

I call it a &quot;bullshit generator&quot; because it generates output &quot;with indifference to the truth&quot;.

The same applies to many other &quot;generative systems&quot;, for the same reasons

The widespread public error of attributing intelligence to those systems leads millions of people to a misplaced trust for them. Please join me in spreading the word that people should not trust systems that mindlessly play with words to be correct in what those words mean.

Another reason to reject ChatGPT in particular is that users cannot get a copy of it. It is unreleased software -- users cannot get even an executable to run, let alone the source code. The only way to use it is by talking to a server which keeps users at arm&apos;s length.

Doing your own computing via software running on someone else&apos;s server inherently trashes your computing freedom." created="Tue, 09 Dec 2025 12:42:24 GMT" category="openai,surveillance,harms,chatgpt" />

Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows." created="Fri, 28 Nov 2025 11:22:29 GMT" category="video,performance,optimization,qwen,ai,cn" />

It also raised doubts over the billions of dollars being spent to build the data centres needed to operate powerful models. ----- China has overtaken the US in the global market for “open” artificial intelligence models, gaining a crucial edge over how the powerful technology is used around the world. A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and open-source AI start-up Hugging Face found that the total share of downloads of new Chinese-made open models rose to 17 per cent in the past year. The figure surpasses the 15.8 per cent share of downloads from American developers such as Google, Meta and OpenAI — the first time Chinese groups have beaten their American counterparts. Open models — which are free to download, modify and integrate by developers — make it easier for start-ups to create products and researchers to improve them. Widespread adoption will confer outsized influence over AI’s future.

We present DeepSeek-OCR as an initial investigation into the feasibility of compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping. DeepSeek-OCR consists of two components: Deep Encoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder. Specifically, DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a compression ratio &lt; 10x), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of 97%. Even at a compression ratio of 20x, the OCR accuracy still remains at about 60%. This shows considerable promise for research areas such as historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs. Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value.
On OmniDoBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 (6000+ tokens per page on average) while utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens.

Implemented responsibly, pay-to-crawl could represent a way for websites to sustain the creation and sharing of their content, and manage substitutive uses, keeping content publicly accessible where it might otherwise not be shared or would disappear behind even more restrictive paywalls.

However, we do have significant reservations.

Pay-to-crawl may represent an appropriate strategy for independent websites seeking to prevent AI crawlers from knocking them offline or to generate supplementary revenue. But elsewhere, pay-to-crawl systems could be cynically exploited by rightsholders to generate excessive profits, at the expense of human access and without necessarily benefiting the original creators.

Implemented responsibly, pay-to-crawl could represent a way for websites to sustain the creation and sharing of their content, and manage substitutive uses, keeping content publicly accessible where it might otherwise not be shared or would disappear behind even more restrictive paywalls.

However, we do have significant reservations.

Pay-to-crawl may represent an appropriate strategy for independent websites seeking to prevent AI crawlers from knocking them offline or to generate supplementary revenue. But elsewhere, pay-to-crawl systems could be cynically exploited by rightsholders to generate excessive profits, at the expense of human access and without necessarily benefiting the original creators.

Supporters of more-stringent AI regulations launched their own effort this week, aiming to raise at least $50 million to help candidates who support more AI regulation.
The biggest player so far is Leading the Future, a super PAC that has said it would use donations of more than $100 million to “reshape the political environment around innovation policy.” The group has vowed to support candidates of both parties who mirror the industry’s priorities and “aggressively oppose” those who jeopardize them.

Laws by states could cause the loss of federal funding, by its design and emphasis on &quot;truthful outputs&quot; and opposition to laws requiring models to &quot;alter their truthful outputs&quot; suggests resistance to certain bias mitigation requirements. This could influence how companies approach fairness interventions in their models.  //


(4) That evaluation of State AI laws shall, at a minimum, identify laws that require AI models to alter their truthful outputs, or that may compel AI developers or deployers to disclose or report information in a manner that would violate the First Amendment or any other provision of the Constitution.  The evaluation may additionally identify State laws that promote AI innovation consistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order.

(7) &quot;That policy statement must explain the circumstances under which State laws that require alterations to the truthful outputs of AI models are preempted by the Federal Trade Commission Act&apos;s prohibition on engaging in deceptive acts or practices affecting commerce.&quot;

The setup for this framing appears here:

(1) &quot;State laws are increasingly responsible for requiring entities to embed ideological bias within models.

While still crucial to the team, the role of our animators is no longer to draw animation curves, creating state transitions, or blending clips. They’re here to train agents, just like us. While engineers like myself approach it from an algorithmic perspective, they do it with an animator’s eye for detail: Does it look nice? Does it telegraph correctly? Does it look credible? Much like a choreographer, they direct the feeling and intent of the final movement, rather than moving each leg themselves.

“Introducing new procedural tools requires acceptance and a change of mindset.”

In this new workflow, our colleagues have to work at a higher level of abstraction: instead of deciding animation curves, they describe movement behaviors that the machine learning should respect. Similarly, our game designers aren’t able to decide exact movements for an agent. Instead, they provide goals and instructions that are then fulfilled by the agent based on how it was trained." created="Fri, 24 Oct 2025 11:40:24 GMT" category="ai,data-science,machine-learning" />

It also raised doubts over the billions of dollars being spent to build the data centres needed to operate powerful models. ----- China has overtaken the US in the global market for “open” artificial intelligence models, gaining a crucial edge over how the powerful technology is used around the world. A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and open-source AI start-up Hugging Face found that the total share of downloads of new Chinese-made open models rose to 17 per cent in the past year. The figure surpasses the 15.8 per cent share of downloads from American developers such as Google, Meta and OpenAI — the first time Chinese groups have beaten their American counterparts. Open models — which are free to download, modify and integrate by developers — make it easier for start-ups to create products and researchers to improve them. Widespread adoption will confer outsized influence over AI’s future.

We overcome the poor signal quality plaguing prior work and build the first general parser that can handle the diverse protocols in use by heterogeneous endpoints. We found 50% of GEO links contained cleartext IP traffic; while link-layer encryption has been standard practice in satellite TV for decades, IP links typically lacked encryption at both the link and network layers. This gives us a unique view into the internal network security practices of these organizations. We observed unencrypted cellular backhaul traffic from several providers including cleartext call and text contents, job scheduling and industrial control systems for utility infrastructure, military asset tracking, " created="Tue, 14 Oct 2025 10:10:19 GMT" category="pdf,documentation" />

Assuming that higher end, a ChatGPT prompt by Sam Altman&apos;s estimate uses:

0.34 Wh / (240 Wh / 3600 seconds) = 5.1 seconds of Netflix

Or double that, 10.2 seconds, if you take the lower end of the Netflix estimate instead.

I&apos;m always interested in anything that can help contextualize a number like &quot;0.34 watt-hours&quot; - I think this comparison to Netflix is a neat way of doing that.

In order for Amazon to recognize particular people, it will need to perform face recognition on every person that steps in front of the camera. Even if a camera owner does not tag a particular face, Amazon says it may retain that biometric information for up to six months. Amazon said it does not currently use the biometric data for “model training or algorithmic purposes.”

In order to biometrically identify you, a company typically will take your image and extract a faceprint by taking tiny measurements of your face and converting that into a series of numbers that is saved for later.

We are excited to introduce Grok 4.1, which brings significant improvements to the real-world usability of Grok. Our 4.1 model is exceptionally capable in creative, emotional, and collaborative interactions. It is more perceptive to nuanced intent, compelling to speak with, and coherent in personality, while fully retaining the razor-sharp intelligence and reliability of its predecessors. To achieve this, we used the same large scale reinforcement learning infrastructure that powered Grok 4 and applied it to optimize the style, personality, helpfulness, and alignment of the model. In order to optimize these non-verifiable reward signals, we developed new methods that let us use frontier agentic reasoning models as reward models to autonomously evaluate and iterate on responses at scale

All of this is happening every day with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google models, too. As we look forward, the risk of model collapse - models training themselves into oblivion on their own slop - isn&apos;t that models become less useful but that they become even more fundamentally prone to support bifurcated constructed realities. All the while, for most of us, all of this is happening in a paralyzing field of uncertainty. We are faced with the choice between lacking all conviction and being full of passionate intensity. When I see a video or an image, I doubt it immediately. I feel completely ill-equipped to speak to its veracity and terrified to stake my credibility on its authenticity. More often than ever I find it necessary to ask myself what I need to be true and to challenge it. More than ever I find it hard to justify how I spend my time online against what I know that social networks are doing to the way that I think.

In order for Amazon to recognize particular people, it will need to perform face recognition on every person that steps in front of the camera. Even if a camera owner does not tag a particular face, Amazon says it may retain that biometric information for up to six months. Amazon said it does not currently use the biometric data for “model training or algorithmic purposes.”

In order to biometrically identify you, a company typically will take your image and extract a faceprint by taking tiny measurements of your face and converting that into a series of numbers that is saved for later. When you step in front of a camera again, the company takes a new faceprint and compares it to a list of previous prints to find a match. Other forms of biometric tracking can be done with a scan of your fingertip, eyeball, or even your particular gait.

Amazon has told reporters that the feature will be off by default and that it would be unavailable in certain jurisdictions with the most active biometric privacy enforcement—including the states of Illinois and Texas, and the city of Portland, Oregon.

I define &quot;intelligence&quot; as being capable of knowing or understanding, at least within some domain. ChatGPT cannot know or understand anything, so it is not intelligence. It does not know what its output means. It has no idea that words can mean anything.

I call it a &quot;bullshit generator&quot; because it generates output &quot;with indifference to the truth&quot;.

The same applies to many other &quot;generative systems&quot;, for the same reasons

The widespread public error of attributing intelligence to those systems leads millions of people to a misplaced trust for them. Please join me in spreading the word that people should not trust systems that mindlessly play with words to be correct in what those words mean.

Another reason to reject ChatGPT in particular is that users cannot get a copy of it. It is unreleased software -- users cannot get even an executable to run, let alone the source code. The only way to use it is by talking to a server which keeps users at arm&apos;s length.

Doing your own computing via software running on someone else&apos;s server inherently trashes your computing freedom." created="Tue, 09 Dec 2025 12:42:24 GMT" category="openai,surveillance,harms,chatgpt" />

To support global productions and stay aligned with best practices, we expect all production partners to share any intended use of GenAI with their Netflix contact, especially as new tools continue to emerge with different capabilities and risks. 

Most low-risk use cases that follow the guiding principles below are unlikely to require legal review.

Rather than compressing information like a black box, these models function as reversible encoders, preserving the full structure of their inputs from initialization through training. 

The implications for safety and privacy are equally significant: injectivity allows for activation-based anomaly detection to defend against adversarial attacks, but it also raises concerns about data recovery and intellectual property, since original prompts could potentially be extracted. As a result, new approaches—such as deliberately “forgetful” architectures or blockchain-style provenance tracking—may be needed to protect sensitive information. Overall, this discovery reframes language models as verifiable and interpretable systems, offering new trust and accountability in critical domains like law, healthcare, and governance, while demanding fresh ethical and regulatory safeguards." created="Thu, 30 Oct 2025 10:56:01 GMT" category="llms,audit,privacy,ip,legal" />

Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 MLCommons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of open-weight judge models and a human-validated stratified subset (with double-annotations to measure agreement). Disagreements were manually resolved. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches.

Supporters of more-stringent AI regulations launched their own effort this week, aiming to raise at least $50 million to help candidates who support more AI regulation.
The biggest player so far is Leading the Future, a super PAC that has said it would use donations of more than $100 million to “reshape the political environment around innovation policy.” The group has vowed to support candidates of both parties who mirror the industry’s priorities and “aggressively oppose” those who jeopardize them.
The super PAC said Andreessen Horowitz committed $25 million this year and $25 million next year, as have Brockman and his wife, Anna Brockman.

 Life is mostly doing anaerobic respiration until this point, when some guys start making their own sugars and storing them. These guys are tasty. Previously bacteria were too un-nutritious to eat, but photosynthetic organisms are now worth hunting and eating. This kicks off aerobic respiration, which is more efficient.

Animals and fungi, the two multicellular respiratory (in this context, as opposed to photosynthetic) branches of life, chose different paths: fungi wait for sugar-containing life to die and eat through external digestion by secreting enzymes.

Rather than compressing information like a black box, these models function as reversible encoders, preserving the full structure of their inputs from initialization through training. 

The implications for safety and privacy are equally significant: injectivity allows for activation-based anomaly detection to defend against adversarial attacks, but it also raises concerns about data recovery and intellectual property, since original prompts could potentially be extracted. As a result, new approaches—such as deliberately “forgetful” architectures or blockchain-style provenance tracking—may be needed to protect sensitive information. Overall, this discovery reframes language models as verifiable and interpretable systems, offering new trust and accountability in critical domains like law, healthcare, and governance, while demanding fresh ethical and regulatory safeguards." created="Thu, 30 Oct 2025 10:56:01 GMT" category="llms,audit,privacy,ip,legal" />

Implemented responsibly, pay-to-crawl could represent a way for websites to sustain the creation and sharing of their content, and manage substitutive uses, keeping content publicly accessible where it might otherwise not be shared or would disappear behind even more restrictive paywalls.

However, we do have significant reservations.

Pay-to-crawl may represent an appropriate strategy for independent websites seeking to prevent AI crawlers from knocking them offline or to generate supplementary revenue. But elsewhere, pay-to-crawl systems could be cynically exploited by rightsholders to generate excessive profits, at the expense of human access and without necessarily benefiting the original creators.

We are excited to introduce Grok 4.1, which brings significant improvements to the real-world usability of Grok. Our 4.1 model is exceptionally capable in creative, emotional, and collaborative interactions. It is more perceptive to nuanced intent, compelling to speak with, and coherent in personality, while fully retaining the razor-sharp intelligence and reliability of its predecessors. To achieve this, we used the same large scale reinforcement learning infrastructure that powered Grok 4 and applied it to optimize the style, personality, helpfulness, and alignment of the model. In order to optimize these non-verifiable reward signals, we developed new methods that let us use frontier agentic reasoning models as reward models to autonomously evaluate and iterate on responses at scale

They are now integral to workflows, applications, and agentic systems, transforming how information is generated, mediated, and consumed.

The past year catalyzed a step change in how the field conceives reasoning. The emergence of o1-class models normalized extended deliberation and tool use, shifting evaluation beyond single-shot benchmarks toward process-based metrics, latency-cost tradeoffs, and success-on-task under orchestration. Reasoning has become a measure of how effectively models can plan and verify to deliver more reliable outcomes.

The data show that the LLM ecosystem is structurally plural. No single model or provider dominates; instead, users select systems along multiple axes such as capability, latency, price, and trust depending on context. This heterogeneity is not a transient phase but a fundamental property of the market. It promotes rapid iteration and reduces systemic dependence on any one model or stack.

Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 MLCommons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of open-weight judge models and a human-validated stratified subset (with double-annotations to measure agreement). Disagreements were manually resolved. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches. These findings demonstrate that stylistic variation alone can circumvent contemporary safety mechanisms, suggesting fundamental limitations in current alignment methods and evaluation protocols." created="Thu, 20 Nov 2025 19:10:44 GMT" category="jailbreak,poetry,llms" />

Rather than compressing information like a black box, these models function as reversible encoders, preserving the full structure of their inputs from initialization through training. 

The implications for safety and privacy are equally significant: injectivity allows for activation-based anomaly detection to defend against adversarial attacks, but it also raises concerns about data recovery and intellectual property, since original prompts could potentially be extracted. As a result, new approaches—such as deliberately “forgetful” architectures or blockchain-style provenance tracking—may be needed to protect sensitive information. Overall, this discovery reframes language models as verifiable and interpretable systems, offering new trust and accountability in critical domains like law, healthcare, and governance, while demanding fresh ethical and regulatory safeguards." created="Thu, 30 Oct 2025 10:56:01 GMT" category="llms,audit,privacy,ip,legal" />

While still crucial to the team, the role of our animators is no longer to draw animation curves, creating state transitions, or blending clips. They’re here to train agents, just like us. While engineers like myself approach it from an algorithmic perspective, they do it with an animator’s eye for detail: Does it look nice? Does it telegraph correctly? Does it look credible? Much like a choreographer, they direct the feeling and intent of the final movement, rather than moving each leg themselves.

“Introducing new procedural tools requires acceptance and a change of mindset.”

In this new workflow, our colleagues have to work at a higher level of abstraction: instead of deciding animation curves, they describe movement behaviors that the machine learning should respect. Similarly, our game designers aren’t able to decide exact movements for an agent. Instead, they provide goals and instructions that are then fulfilled by the agent based on how it was trained." created="Fri, 24 Oct 2025 11:40:24 GMT" category="ai,data-science,machine-learning" />

Most organizations are still in the experimentation or piloting phase: Nearly two-thirds of respondents say their organizations have not yet begun scaling AI across the enterprise.

High curiosity in AI agents: Sixty-two percent of survey respondents say their organizations are at least experimenting with AI agents.

Positive leading indicators on impact of AI: Respondents report use-case-level cost and revenue benefits, and 64 percent say that AI is enabling their innovation. However, just 39 percent report EBIT impact at the enterprise level.

High performers use AI to drive growth, innovation, and cost: Eighty percent of respondents say their companies set efficiency as an objective of their AI initiatives, but the companies seeing the most value from AI often set growth or innovation as additional objectives." created="Tue, 09 Dec 2025 12:14:50 GMT" category="mckinsey,agents,report" />

Through four experiments with 123 young nonmusicians, integrating eye-tracking, neurophysiological recordings, white matter structural imaging, and behavioral analysis, we reveal a previously unrecognized form of synchronization: spontaneous eye blinks synchronize with musical beats. Blinks robustly synchronized with beats across a range of tempi and independently of melodic cues. Electroencephalogram recordings revealed a dynamic correspondence between blink timing and neural beat tracking.

We advocate for a hybrid, defense-in-depth strategy that combines the strengths of traditional, deterministic security controls with dynamic, reasoning-based defenses. This approach is grounded in three core principles: agents must have well-defined human controllers, their powers must be carefully limited, and their actions and planning must be observable.

There are eight loops of girls’ voices and about fourteen loops of piano. 

I just set all of these loops running and let them configure in whichever way they wanted to, and in fact the result is very, very nice. The interesting thing is that it doesn’t sound at all mechanical or mathematical as you would imagine. It sounds like some guy is sitting there playing the piano with quite intense feeling. The spacing and dynamics of “his” playing sound very well organized.

Blinks robustly synchronized with beats across a range of tempi and independently of melodic cues. Electroencephalogram recordings revealed a dynamic correspondence between blink timing and neural beat tracking. Blink synchronization performance was linked to white matter microstructure variation in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus, a key sensorimotor pathway.

Russia in isolation and must instead be prepared to deter or counter both simultaneously.
To compete and deter in a two-rival space environment, the U.S. Space Force (USSF) should
adopt a more proactive approach and match resilience efforts with investments in counterspace capabilities that would enable the United States to apply a deterrence-by-punishment
approach in space. Such an approach would suggest developing, exercising, and selectively
revealing space weapons. Leveraging these weapons would enable deterrence-by-punishment options and support cost imposition during both peacetime and conflict. Ultimately,
balancing resilience with a more proactive strategy that adopts a two-rival force concept
would provide the United States with a framework to strengthen U.S. freedom of action in
space and on Earth." created="Thu, 06 Nov 2025 18:07:07 GMT" category="space,threat,assessment,strategic,report,nat-sec" />

In March 2020 George Kamiya of the International Energy Agency estimated that &quot;streaming a Netflix video in 2019 typically consumed 0.12-0.24kWh of electricity per hour&quot; - that&apos;s 240 watt-hours per Netflix hour at the higher end.

Assuming that higher end, a ChatGPT prompt by Sam Altman&apos;s estimate uses:

0.34 Wh / (240 Wh / 3600 seconds) = 5.1 seconds of Netflix

Or double that, 10.2 seconds, if you take the lower end of the Netflix estimate instead.

I&apos;m always interested in anything that can help contextualize a number like &quot;0.34 watt-hours&quot; - I think this comparison to Netflix is a neat way of doing that.

I define &quot;intelligence&quot; as being capable of knowing or understanding, at least within some domain. ChatGPT cannot know or understand anything, so it is not intelligence. It does not know what its output means. It has no idea that words can mean anything.

I call it a &quot;bullshit generator&quot; because it generates output &quot;with indifference to the truth&quot;.

The same applies to many other &quot;generative systems&quot;, for the same reasons

The widespread public error of attributing intelligence to those systems leads millions of people to a misplaced trust for them. Please join me in spreading the word that people should not trust systems that mindlessly play with words to be correct in what those words mean.

Another reason to reject ChatGPT in particular is that users cannot get a copy of it. It is unreleased software -- users cannot get even an executable to run, let alone the source code. The only way to use it is by talking to a server which keeps users at arm&apos;s length.

They are now integral to workflows, applications, and agentic systems, transforming how information is generated, mediated, and consumed.

The past year catalyzed a step change in how the field conceives reasoning. The emergence of o1-class models normalized extended deliberation and tool use, shifting evaluation beyond single-shot benchmarks toward process-based metrics, latency-cost tradeoffs, and success-on-task under orchestration. Reasoning has become a measure of how effectively models can plan and verify to deliver more reliable outcomes.

The data show that the LLM ecosystem is structurally plural. No single model or provider dominates; instead, users select systems along multiple axes such as capability, latency, price, and trust depending on context. This heterogeneity is not a transient phase but a fundamental property of the market. It promotes rapid iteration and reduces systemic dependence on any one model or stack.

We curated a subset of data for diverse activity recognition across contexts (e.g., household activities, sports) from the Ego4D dataset. Evaluated LLMs achieved 12-class zero- and one-shot classification F1-scores significantly above chance, with no task-specific training. Zero-shot classification via LLM-based fusion from modality-specific models can enable multimodal temporal applications where there is limited aligned training data for learning a shared embedding space. Additionally, LLM-based fusion can enable model deploying without requiring additional memory and computation for targeted application-specific multimodal models." created="Sun, 23 Nov 2025 00:37:37 GMT" category="llm,privacy,audio,security,opsec,apple,study" />

Underlying the observed patterns is both the diurnal rotation of the Earth, day and night, and the synchrony required for contingency of actions between individuals. We find that urban areas show a cyclic contraction and expansion that resembles heartbeats linked to social rather than natural cycles. Different urban areas have characteristic signatures of daily collective activities. We show that the differences detected are consistent with a new emergent global synchrony that couples behaviour in distant regions across the world. Although local synchrony is the major force that shapes the collective behaviour in cities, a larger-scale synchronization is beginning to occur." created="Sat, 18 Oct 2025 14:10:45 GMT" category="human,behavior,patterns,social-media,synchrony" />

Implemented responsibly, pay-to-crawl could represent a way for websites to sustain the creation and sharing of their content, and manage substitutive uses, keeping content publicly accessible where it might otherwise not be shared or would disappear behind even more restrictive paywalls.

However, we do have significant reservations.

Pay-to-crawl may represent an appropriate strategy for independent websites seeking to prevent AI crawlers from knocking them offline or to generate supplementary revenue. But elsewhere, pay-to-crawl systems could be cynically exploited by rightsholders to generate excessive profits, at the expense of human access and without necessarily benefiting the original creators.

We overcome the poor signal quality plaguing prior work and build the first general parser that can handle the diverse protocols in use by heterogeneous endpoints. We found 50% of GEO links contained cleartext IP traffic; while link-layer encryption has been standard practice in satellite TV for decades, IP links typically lacked encryption at both the link and network layers.

If these properties exist throughout our knowledge graph, we can make robust networks for rapid evidence-based decision making.

Will building these collective knowledge systems be a transformative capability for human society? Hot on the heels of COP30 concluding indecisively, I&apos;ve been getting excited by decision making towards biodiversity going down a more positive path in IPBES. We could empower decisionmakers at all scales (local, country, international) to be able to move five times faster on actions about global species extinctions, unsustainable wildlife trade and food security, while rapidly assimilating extraordinarily complex evidence chains.

Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 MLCommons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of open-weight judge models and a human-validated stratified subset (with double-annotations to measure agreement). Disagreements were manually resolved. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches. These findings demonstrate that stylistic variation alone can circumvent contemporary safety mechanisms, suggesting fundamental limitations in current alignment methods and evaluation protocols." created="Thu, 20 Nov 2025 19:10:44 GMT" category="jailbreak,poetry,llms" />

And so that&apos;s part of what&apos;s going on.

But hope for me has never been optimism. Optimism is &quot;everything will be fine,&quot; which invites people to kick back and wait for &quot;fine&quot; to arrive of its own accord. Hope for me is always that there are possibilities. And we have a responsibility to try to realize them, and to not realize the worst possibilities. The future is being made in the present. So hope for me is not about prophesying a future that everything will be fine. It&apos;s reminding people that we&apos;ve changed the world before, and that we can again: we know how it works.

In order for Amazon to recognize particular people, it will need to perform face recognition on every person that steps in front of the camera. Even if a camera owner does not tag a particular face, Amazon says it may retain that biometric information for up to six months. Amazon said it does not currently use the biometric data for “model training or algorithmic purposes.”

In order to biometrically identify you, a company typically will take your image and extract a faceprint by taking tiny measurements of your face and converting that into a series of numbers that is saved for later. When you step in front of a camera again, the company takes a new faceprint and compares it to a list of previous prints to find a match. Other forms of biometric tracking can be done with a scan of your fingertip, eyeball, or even your particular gait.

Amazon has told reporters that the feature will be off by default and that it would be unavailable in certain jurisdictions with the most active biometric privacy enforcement—including the states of Illinois and Texas, and the city of Portland, Oregon.

Rather than compressing information like a black box, these models function as reversible encoders, preserving the full structure of their inputs from initialization through training. 

The implications for safety and privacy are equally significant: injectivity allows for activation-based anomaly detection to defend against adversarial attacks, but it also raises concerns about data recovery and intellectual property, since original prompts could potentially be extracted. As a result, new approaches—such as deliberately “forgetful” architectures or blockchain-style provenance tracking—may be needed to protect sensitive information.

Supporters of more-stringent AI regulations launched their own effort this week, aiming to raise at least $50 million to help candidates who support more AI regulation.
The biggest player so far is Leading the Future, a super PAC that has said it would use donations of more than $100 million to “reshape the political environment around innovation policy.” The group has vowed to support candidates of both parties who mirror the industry’s priorities and “aggressively oppose” those who jeopardize them.

Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows." created="Fri, 28 Nov 2025 11:22:29 GMT" category="video,performance,optimization,qwen,ai,cn" />

Laws by states could cause the loss of federal funding, by its design and emphasis on &quot;truthful outputs&quot; and opposition to laws requiring models to &quot;alter their truthful outputs&quot; suggests resistance to certain bias mitigation requirements. This could influence how companies approach fairness interventions in their models.  //


(4) That evaluation of State AI laws shall, at a minimum, identify laws that require AI models to alter their truthful outputs, or that may compel AI developers or deployers to disclose or report information in a manner that would violate the First Amendment or any other provision of the Constitution.  The evaluation may additionally identify State laws that promote AI innovation consistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order.

His office&apos;s leak of CIA agent Valerie Plame&apos;s identity for political revenge further betrayed U.S. intelligence, painting a portrait of unchecked power and moral hypocrisy.

They want the only source of information of truth to be themselves, which is why they have to dismantle the deeply democratic nature of fact, truth, history, and science. And so that&apos;s part of what&apos;s going on.

But hope for me has never been optimism. Optimism is &quot;everything will be fine,&quot; which invites people to kick back and wait for &quot;fine&quot; to arrive of its own accord. Hope for me is always that there are possibilities. And we have a responsibility to try to realize them, and to not realize the worst possibilities. The future is being made in the present. So hope for me is not about prophesying a future that everything will be fine. It&apos;s reminding people that we&apos;ve changed the world before, and that we can again: we know how it works. And in a crisis like this, we better get on with it." created="Thu, 06 Nov 2025 18:20:14 GMT" category="us politics,authoritarianism,political commentary,resistance movements,democracy" />

2.4 billion years ago, a bacterium cracks photosynthesis, setting off the Great Oxygenation Event, etc. Here’s a related timeline from another notes post:

 Life is mostly doing anaerobic respiration until this point, when some guys start making their own sugars and storing them. These guys are tasty. Previously bacteria were too un-nutritious to eat, but photosynthetic organisms are now worth hunting and eating. This kicks off aerobic respiration, which is more efficient.

Animals and fungi, the two multicellular respiratory (in this context, as opposed to photosynthetic) branches of life, chose different paths: fungi wait for sugar-containing life to die and eat through external digestion by secreting enzymes. Animals have a weird pocket for this." created="Sat, 18 Oct 2025 18:50:36 GMT" category="book,resource,intelligence,learning" />

AI for scientific and technical research: data analysis, anomaly detection, simulation, predictive maintenance and optimisation of accelerator performance or detector operations, and
AI for productivity and administrative use: document drafting, note taking, automated translation, language correction and enhancement, coding assistants, and workflow automation.

We find that urban areas show a cyclic contraction and expansion that resembles heartbeats linked to social rather than natural cycles. Different urban areas have characteristic signatures of daily collective activities. We show that the differences detected are consistent with a new emergent global synchrony that couples behaviour in distant regions across the world.

Laws by states could cause the loss of federal funding, by its design and emphasis on &quot;truthful outputs&quot; and opposition to laws requiring models to &quot;alter their truthful outputs&quot; suggests resistance to certain bias mitigation requirements. This could influence how companies approach fairness interventions in their models.  //


(4) That evaluation of State AI laws shall, at a minimum, identify laws that require AI models to alter their truthful outputs, or that may compel AI developers or deployers to disclose or report information in a manner that would violate the First Amendment or any other provision of the Constitution.  The evaluation may additionally identify State laws that promote AI innovation consistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order.

(7) &quot;That policy statement must explain the circumstances under which State laws that require alterations to the truthful outputs of AI models are preempted by the Federal Trade Commission Act&apos;s prohibition on engaging in deceptive acts or practices affecting commerce.&quot;

The setup for this framing appears here:

(1) &quot;State laws are increasingly responsible for requiring entities to embed ideological bias within models.

Nowadays, we can unearth bones, extract DNA, even map ancient migrations, but only in myths can we glimpse the inner lives of our forebears—their fears and longings, their sense of wonder and dread.

In order for Amazon to recognize particular people, it will need to perform face recognition on every person that steps in front of the camera. Even if a camera owner does not tag a particular face, Amazon says it may retain that biometric information for up to six months. Amazon said it does not currently use the biometric data for “model training or algorithmic purposes.”

In order to biometrically identify you, a company typically will take your image and extract a faceprint by taking tiny measurements of your face and converting that into a series of numbers that is saved for later. When you step in front of a camera again, the company takes a new faceprint and compares it to a list of previous prints to find a match. Other forms of biometric tracking can be done with a scan of your fingertip, eyeball, or even your particular gait.

Amazon has told reporters that the feature will be off by default and that it would be unavailable in certain jurisdictions with the most active biometric privacy enforcement—including the states of Illinois and Texas, and the city of Portland, Oregon.

I define &quot;intelligence&quot; as being capable of knowing or understanding, at least within some domain. ChatGPT cannot know or understand anything, so it is not intelligence. It does not know what its output means. It has no idea that words can mean anything.

I call it a &quot;bullshit generator&quot; because it generates output &quot;with indifference to the truth&quot;.

The same applies to many other &quot;generative systems&quot;, for the same reasons

The widespread public error of attributing intelligence to those systems leads millions of people to a misplaced trust for them. Please join me in spreading the word that people should not trust systems that mindlessly play with words to be correct in what those words mean.

Another reason to reject ChatGPT in particular is that users cannot get a copy of it. It is unreleased software -- users cannot get even an executable to run, let alone the source code. The only way to use it is by talking to a server which keeps users at arm&apos;s length.

Doing your own computing via software running on someone else&apos;s server inherently trashes your computing freedom." created="Tue, 09 Dec 2025 12:42:24 GMT" category="openai,surveillance,harms,chatgpt" />

Through four experiments with 123 young nonmusicians, integrating eye-tracking, neurophysiological recordings, white matter structural imaging, and behavioral analysis, we reveal a previously unrecognized form of synchronization: spontaneous eye blinks synchronize with musical beats. Blinks robustly synchronized with beats across a range of tempi and independently of melodic cues. Electroencephalogram recordings revealed a dynamic correspondence between blink timing and neural beat tracking. Blink synchronization performance was linked to white matter microstructure variation in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus, a key sensorimotor pathway. Additionally, the strength of blink synchronization reflected the modulation of dynamic auditory attention.

Here we study global dynamical patterns of communication on Twitter across many scales. Underlying the observed patterns is both the diurnal rotation of the Earth, day and night, and the synchrony required for contingency of actions between individuals. We find that urban areas show a cyclic contraction and expansion that resembles heartbeats linked to social rather than natural cycles. Different urban areas have characteristic signatures of daily collective activities. We show that the differences detected are consistent with a new emergent global synchrony that couples behaviour in distant regions across the world. Although local synchrony is the major force that shapes the collective behaviour in cities, a larger-scale synchronization is beginning to occur." created="Sat, 18 Oct 2025 14:10:45 GMT" category="human,behavior,patterns,social-media,synchrony" />

Just as the dominance of fast food has conditioned global tastes toward highly processed, calorie-dense meals — sacrificing nuance and nutritional diversity for appetizing ease — AI is streamlining the landscape of human knowledge, favoring the familiar over the original, the efficient over the thought-provoking." created="Sat, 29 Nov 2025 19:10:00 GMT" category="ai,creativity,thinking" />

Russia in isolation and must instead be prepared to deter or counter both simultaneously.
To compete and deter in a two-rival space environment, the U.S. Space Force (USSF) should
adopt a more proactive approach and match resilience efforts with investments in counterspace capabilities that would enable the United States to apply a deterrence-by-punishment
approach in space. Such an approach would suggest developing, exercising, and selectively
revealing space weapons. Leveraging these weapons would enable deterrence-by-punishment options and support cost imposition during both peacetime and conflict. Ultimately,
balancing resilience with a more proactive strategy that adopts a two-rival force concept
would provide the United States with a framework to strengthen U.S. freedom of action in

Laws by states could cause the loss of federal funding, by its design and emphasis on &quot;truthful outputs&quot; and opposition to laws requiring models to &quot;alter their truthful outputs&quot; suggests resistance to certain bias mitigation requirements. This could influence how companies approach fairness interventions in their models.  //


(4) That evaluation of State AI laws shall, at a minimum, identify laws that require AI models to alter their truthful outputs, or that may compel AI developers or deployers to disclose or report information in a manner that would violate the First Amendment or any other provision of the Constitution.  The evaluation may additionally identify State laws that promote AI innovation consistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order.

(7) &quot;That policy statement must explain the circumstances under which State laws that require alterations to the truthful outputs of AI models are preempted by the Federal Trade Commission Act&apos;s prohibition on engaging in deceptive acts or practices affecting commerce.&quot;

The setup for this framing appears here:

(1) &quot;State laws are increasingly responsible for requiring entities to embed ideological bias within models.

Hope for me is always that there are possibilities. And we have a responsibility to try to realize them, and to not realize the worst possibilities. The future is being made in the present. So hope for me is not about prophesying a future that everything will be fine. It&apos;s reminding people that we&apos;ve changed the world before, and that we can again: we know how it works. And in a crisis like this, we better get on with it." created="Thu, 06 Nov 2025 18:20:14 GMT" category="us politics,authoritarianism,political commentary,resistance movements,democracy" />

The Treasury Department has data about any money received from the government. The Office of Personnel Management has an enormous amount of detailed information about government employees—including the very personal form required to get a security clearance. The Census Bureau possesses vast data about everyone living in the U.S., including, for example, a database of real estate ownership in the country.

Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows." created="Fri, 28 Nov 2025 11:22:29 GMT" category="video,performance,optimization,qwen,ai,cn" />

Our 4.1 model is exceptionally capable in creative, emotional, and collaborative interactions. It is more perceptive to nuanced intent, compelling to speak with, and coherent in personality, while fully retaining the razor-sharp intelligence and reliability of its predecessors. To achieve this, we used the same large scale reinforcement learning infrastructure that powered Grok 4 and applied it to optimize the style, personality, helpfulness, and alignment of the model. In order to optimize these non-verifiable reward signals, we developed new methods that let us use frontier agentic reasoning models as reward models to autonomously evaluate and iterate on responses at scale

Our analysis reveals that receiving a smartphone before age 13 is associated with poorer mind health outcomes in young adulthood, particularly among females, including suicidal thoughts, detachment from reality, poorer emotional regulation, and diminished self-worth. These correlations are mediated through several factors, including social media access, cyberbullying, disrupted sleep, and poor family relationships. This trend appears consistently across all global regions with the magnitude greatest in English-speaking nations" created="Sat, 22 Nov 2025 23:46:37 GMT" category="Smartphones,technology,mentalhealth,mind,health,wellbeing,childhood,youth,development" />

Many machine learning systems are built on data that was collected without the consent of its authors. In many cases, the resulting products are being used to replace labour, or at least fire and re-hire workers at lower rates. Some of these models cost many billions of dollars to train, so the prospect that a few hundred samples could do irreperable damage to their product should rightfully worry those that are training such systems on stolen data.

From raw sensory data to our eventual judgment/appreciation, multiple factors play a role.

Just as important, these layers are cumulative. Once a new influence is absorbed, it can’t simply be erased, and reshapes every later encounter. For instance, each new piece you hear in a genre subtly changes how you hear the next. Prior knowledge and exposure become part of the lens through which all future experiences are filtered." created="Fri, 31 Oct 2025 11:52:32 GMT" />

We&apos;re seeing significant creative and commercial opportunities in GenAI technology, which is why UMG is playing a pioneering role in fostering its enormous potential in music.

Our foundational belief is that artists, songwriters, music companies and technology companies, all working together will create a healthy and thriving commercial AI ecosystem in which all of us, including fans, can flourish. For several years now, we&apos;ve been driving initiatives with our partners to put artists at the center of the conversation around GenAI. We struck artist-centric agreements, establishing foundations and parameters for innovation, new products -- sorry, innovative new products that will unlock the power of its revolutionary technology. And both creatively and commercially, our portfolio of AI partnerships continues to expand." created="Fri, 31 Oct 2025 11:50:57 GMT" />

Each year we ask the online world to nominate their favourite creative, non-commercial website built in the past 12 months. A panel of selected expert judges drawn from across the wide world of web-based creativity then pick their favourites. Finally, the entire web then votes upon this list to pick its favourite. The winner, as chosen by public vote, wins a small prize and a small handmade trophy (and we hopefully give an even smaller prize to each nominee).

Private: In the era of AI, whoever controls the context holds the power. While data often involves multiple stakeholders, people must serve as primary stewards of their own context, determining how it&apos;s used.

Dedicated: Software should work exclusively for you, ensuring contextual integrity where data use aligns with your expectations. You must be able to trust there are no hidden agendas or conflicting interests.

Plural: No single entity should control the digital spaces we inhabit. Healthy ecosystems require distributed power, interoperability, and meaningful choice for participants.

Adaptable: Software should be open-ended, able to meet the specific, context-dependent needs of each person who uses it.

Prosocial: Technology should enable connection and coordination, helping us become better neighbors, collaborators, and stewards of shared spaces, both online and off.
