  <p style="margin: 4px 0 0 0; color: #006621; font-size: 13px;">aestheticamagazine.com</p><p style="margin: 8px 0 0 0; color: #666; font-style: italic; font-size: 14px;">There is a quiet intensity that permeates Gabrielle Goliath’s Personal Accounts. The South African artist’s ongoing video series inhabits the second‑floor galleries and corridors of MoMA PS1, exploring the reverberations of patriarchal violence across continents. Rather than relying on spoken testimony, the work foregrounds the moments between words: breaths, sighs, laughter and tremors in the body. These intervals become carriers of meaning, revealing what is often rendered invisible in conventional narratives of trauma. The exhibition asks visitors to pause and attune themselves to gestures that are both fragile and insistent, intimate yet universal. In doing so, it challenges the assumption that speech alone conveys truth.</p>

  <p style="margin: 4px 0 0 0; color: #006621; font-size: 13px;">erikjohannes.no</p><p style="margin: 8px 0 0 0; color: #666; font-style: italic; font-size: 14px;">Regarding the &quot;lump of cognition fallacy&quot;, I fully agree that we need not worry about &quot;draining a finite pool&quot; of thinking, leaving &quot;less thinking&quot; — whatever that means — for humans. There is, however, another fallacy at play here, which is that &quot;it does not matter what we think about, as long as we think about something&quot;. It is easy to be convinced that if a computer can do the simple, boring tasks for me, I can deal with more complex, exciting stuff myself. But we must be aware that certain mental tasks are important for us to do, even though a machine technically could do them for us.

To illustrate: If I outsource all my boring project administration tasks to a chatbot, it can leave more time for my main task: research. But it will also rob me of the opportunity to feel ownership to the project and build a basis for taking high-level decisions in the project. In a hypothetical situation where a chatbot performs all administrative tasks perfectly on my behalf, I will still have lost something, which may again have impact on the project. I&#39;m not saying that no tasks should be automated at all, but we must be aware that we always lose something when automating a process.</p>

  <p style="margin: 4px 0 0 0; color: #006621; font-size: 13px;">theartnewspaper.com</p><p style="margin: 8px 0 0 0; color: #666; font-style: italic; font-size: 14px;">Among Kapoor’s most ambitious unrealised projects are plans for a work in outer space. “It’s realistic in the sense that we’re in serious discussion—I can’t tell you with who—about doing something very ambitious out there, hopefully big enough to see from Earth. [It’s] not just a token,” Kapoor tells The Art Newspaper. It is not confirmed yet whether the model for this work will be unveiled in Venice.

Whether such projects are realised or not is almost immaterial to Kapoor. His Venice show, which opens 5 May, is a chance to explore the more non-commercial side of his work. “It’s about opening up my practice. It’s important that it isn’t restricted to what the market can consume. Yes, there’s a side of my practice that is for sale. But throughout my career I’ve always had all kinds of works—things made out of wax and all sorts of things—I’ve hardly ever sold a single one of those, and in a way that’s what keeps my practice alive. The real, or other, side of my practice has always been important.”</p>

Higgins added: “They don’t appreciate that they live in a society, and they don’t think that they have any obligation to the rest of society, or the rest of the country.”</p>

And I&#39;ll engage here in good faith. But before I get into substance, I implore you to open the window, touch grass, and let yourself connect with the reality of what’s happening right now. This is a world historical moment. Please recognize what ICE is at this time, what it’s doing, and what it really means for your company, Palantir, to be supporting them with targeting and surveillance technologies that aid their attacks on freedom, liberty, and the constitution. 

Now to the substance of your post. I’ll address the three key claims you make in defense of your work with ICE: </p>

The tool receives peoples’ addresses from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) among a range of other sources, according to the material.</p>

W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts presented by Mabel O. Wilson of Columbia University.

Wilson explores the vision of statesman, architect, and planter Thomas Jefferson in designing Virginia’s new statehouse, a neoclassical building based on a Roman temple to symbolize and enable the power of “the people” to govern. She argues that by analyzing Jefferson’s “Notes on the State of Virginia” (1785), which includes an aesthetic and intellectual appraisal of works by enslaved poet Phillis Wheatley and was written during the same period he designed the capitol, we can better understand the complex relationship between democratic ideals and racial difference that shaped the nation’s new civic architecture.</p>

  <p style="margin: 4px 0 0 0; color: #006621; font-size: 13px;">labs.greynoise.io</p><p style="margin: 8px 0 0 0; color: #666; font-style: italic; font-size: 14px;">On January 14, 2026, at approximately 21:00 UTC, something changed in the internet’s plumbing. The GreyNoise Global Observation Grid recorded a sudden, sustained collapse in global telnet traffic — not a gradual decline, not scanner attrition, not a data pipeline problem, but a step function. One hour, ~74,000 sessions. The next, ~22,000. By the following hour, we were down to ~11,000 and the floor held.

Six days later, on January 20, the security advisory for CVE-2026-24061 hit oss-security. By January 26, CISA had added it to the KEV catalog.

We wrote about the first 18 hours of exploitation activity back on January 22. This post is about something different: the structural change in global telnet traffic that preceded the CVE, and why we think the two events may not be independent</p>

People should not be locked into centralised communication silos, but instead be free to pick who they choose to host their communication without limiting who they can reach.
The ability to converse securely and privately is a basic human right.
Communication should be available to everyone as a free and open, unencumbered, standard and global network.
