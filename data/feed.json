Reasoning has become a measure of how effectively models can plan and verify to deliver more reliable outcomes.\n\nThe data show that the LLM ecosystem is structurally plural.

Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 MLCommons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of open-weight judge models and a human-validated stratified subset (with double-annotations to measure agreement). Disagreements were manually resolved. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches.

Much like a choreographer, they direct the feeling and intent of the final movement, rather than moving each leg themselves.\n\n“Introducing new procedural tools requires acceptance and a change of mindset.”\n\nIn this new workflow, our colleagues have to work at a higher level of abstraction: instead of deciding animation curves, they describe movement behaviors that the machine learning should respect. Similarly, our game designers aren’t able to decide exact movements for an agent. Instead, they provide goals and instructions that are then fulfilled by the agent based on how it was trained.</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Tags:</strong> ai, data-science, machine-learning</p>",

Specifically, DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a compression ratio < 10x), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of 97%. Even at a compression ratio of 20x, the OCR accuracy still remains at about 60%. This shows considerable promise for research areas such as historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs. Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value.\nOn OmniDoBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 (6000+ tokens per page on average) while utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens.
