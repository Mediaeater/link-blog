While still crucial to the team, the role of our animators is no longer to draw animation curves, creating state transitions, or blending clips. They’re here to train agents, just like us. While engineers like myself approach it from an algorithmic perspective, they do it with an animator’s eye for detail: Does it look nice? Does it telegraph correctly? Does it look credible? Much like a choreographer, they direct the feeling and intent of the final movement, rather than moving each leg themselves.

“Introducing new procedural tools requires acceptance and a change of mindset.”

In this new workflow, our colleagues have to work at a higher level of abstraction: instead of deciding animation curves, they describe movement behaviors that the machine learning should respect. Similarly, our game designers aren’t able to decide exact movements for an agent. Instead, they provide goals and instructions that are then fulfilled by the agent based on how it was trained." created="Fri, 24 Oct 2025 11:40:24 GMT" category="ai,data-science,machine-learning" />

If we were to simply listen to the smart voices of those who aren&apos;t lost in the hype cycle, we might see that it is not inevitable that AI systems use content without the consent of creators, and it is not impossible to build AI systems that respect commitments to environmental sustainability. We can build AI that isn&apos;t centralized under the control of a handful of giant companies. Or any other definition of &quot;good AI&quot; that people might aspire to. But instead, we end up with the worst, most anti-social approaches because the platforms that have introduced &quot;AI&quot; to the public imagination are run by authoritarian extremists with deeply destructive agendas.

adopt a more proactive approach and match resilience efforts with investments in counterspace capabilities that would enable the United States to apply a deterrence-by-punishment

Rather than compressing information like a black box, these models function as reversible encoders, preserving the full structure of their inputs from initialization through training. 

The implications for safety and privacy are equally significant: injectivity allows for activation-based anomaly detection to defend against adversarial attacks, but it also raises concerns about data recovery and intellectual property, since original prompts could potentially be extracted. As a result, new approaches—such as deliberately “forgetful” architectures or blockchain-style provenance tracking—may be needed to protect sensitive information. Overall, this discovery reframes language models as verifiable and interpretable systems, offering new trust and accountability in critical domains like law, healthcare, and governance, while demanding fresh ethical and regulatory safeguards." created="Thu, 30 Oct 2025 10:56:01 GMT" category="llms,audit,privacy,ip,legal" />

And so that&apos;s part of what&apos;s going on.

But hope for me has never been optimism. Optimism is &quot;everything will be fine,&quot; which invites people to kick back and wait for &quot;fine&quot; to arrive of its own accord. Hope for me is always that there are possibilities. And we have a responsibility to try to realize them, and to not realize the worst possibilities. The future is being made in the present. So hope for me is not about prophesying a future that everything will be fine. It&apos;s reminding people that we&apos;ve changed the world before, and that we can again: we know how it works.

Different urban areas have characteristic signatures of daily collective activities.

We present DeepSeek-OCR as an initial investigation into the feasibility of compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping. DeepSeek-OCR consists of two components: Deep Encoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder. Specifically, DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a compression ratio &lt; 10x), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of 97%. Even at a compression ratio of 20x, the OCR accuracy still remains at about 60%. This shows considerable promise for research areas such as historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs. Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value.
On OmniDoBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 (6000+ tokens per page on average) while utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens. In production, DeepSeek-OCR can generate training data for LLMs/VLMs at a scale of 200k+ pages per day (a single A100-40G).

We present DeepSeek-OCR as an initial investigation into the feasibility of compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping. DeepSeek-OCR consists of two components: Deep Encoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder. Specifically, DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a compression ratio &lt; 10x), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of 97%. Even at a compression ratio of 20x, the OCR accuracy still remains at about 60%. This shows considerable promise for research areas such as historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs. Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value.
On OmniDoBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 (6000+ tokens per page on average) while utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens. In production, DeepSeek-OCR can generate training data for LLMs/VLMs at a scale of 200k+ pages per day (a single A100-40G). Codes and model weights are publicly accessible" created="Wed, 22 Oct 2025 23:19:39 GMT" category="cn,compression" />

While still crucial to the team, the role of our animators is no longer to draw animation curves, creating state transitions, or blending clips. They’re here to train agents, just like us. While engineers like myself approach it from an algorithmic perspective, they do it with an animator’s eye for detail: Does it look nice? Does it telegraph correctly? Does it look credible? Much like a choreographer, they direct the feeling and intent of the final movement, rather than moving each leg themselves.

“Introducing new procedural tools requires acceptance and a change of mindset.”

In this new workflow, our colleagues have to work at a higher level of abstraction: instead of deciding animation curves, they describe movement behaviors that the machine learning should respect. Similarly, our game designers aren’t able to decide exact movements for an agent. Instead, they provide goals and instructions that are then fulfilled by the agent based on how it was trained." created="Fri, 24 Oct 2025 11:40:24 GMT" category="ai,data-science,machine-learning" />

And so that&apos;s part of what&apos;s going on.

But hope for me has never been optimism. Optimism is &quot;everything will be fine,&quot; which invites people to kick back and wait for &quot;fine&quot; to arrive of its own accord. Hope for me is always that there are possibilities. And we have a responsibility to try to realize them, and to not realize the worst possibilities. The future is being made in the present. So hope for me is not about prophesying a future that everything will be fine. It&apos;s reminding people that we&apos;ve changed the world before, and that we can again: we know how it works.

We found 50% of GEO links contained cleartext IP traffic; while link-layer encryption has been standard practice in satellite TV for decades, IP links typically lacked encryption at both the link and network layers.

In order for Amazon to recognize particular people, it will need to perform face recognition on every person that steps in front of the camera. Even if a camera owner does not tag a particular face, Amazon says it may retain that biometric information for up to six months. Amazon said it does not currently use the biometric data for “model training or algorithmic purposes.”

In order to biometrically identify you, a company typically will take your image and extract a faceprint by taking tiny measurements of your face and converting that into a series of numbers that is saved for later. When you step in front of a camera again, the company takes a new faceprint and compares it to a list of previous prints to find a match. Other forms of biometric tracking can be done with a scan of your fingertip, eyeball, or even your particular gait.

Amazon has told reporters that the feature will be off by default and that it would be unavailable in certain jurisdictions with the most active biometric privacy enforcement—including the states of Illinois and Texas, and the city of Portland, Oregon.

A handful of companies own how we learn about the world, giving them the ability to shape our collective worldviews, influence movements, and prioritize their own interests. 

They have never been great actors — Amnesty International accused Meta of platforming a genocide in Myanmar in 2017 — but their influence and power has never been greater than it is today. And every major commercial social network is complicit. They’re collaborators.  We all know about Twitter acquirer Elon Musk, who bent the platform to fit his political worldview. But he’s not alone.

We can build AI that isn&apos;t centralized under the control of a handful of giant companies. Or any other definition of &quot;good AI&quot; that people might aspire to.

This approach is grounded in three core principles: agents must have well-defined human controllers, their powers must be carefully limited, and their actions and planning must be observable.

In order for Amazon to recognize particular people, it will need to perform face recognition on every person that steps in front of the camera. Even if a camera owner does not tag a particular face, Amazon says it may retain that biometric information for up to six months. Amazon said it does not currently use the biometric data for “model training or algorithmic purposes.”

In order to biometrically identify you, a company typically will take your image and extract a faceprint by taking tiny measurements of your face and converting that into a series of numbers that is saved for later. When you step in front of a camera again, the company takes a new faceprint and compares it to a list of previous prints to find a match. Other forms of biometric tracking can be done with a scan of your fingertip, eyeball, or even your particular gait.

Amazon has told reporters that the feature will be off by default and that it would be unavailable in certain jurisdictions with the most active biometric privacy enforcement—including the states of Illinois and Texas, and the city of Portland, Oregon.

We find that urban areas show a cyclic contraction and expansion that resembles heartbeats linked to social rather than natural cycles. Different urban areas have characteristic signatures of daily collective activities. We show that the differences detected are consistent with a new emergent global synchrony that couples behaviour in distant regions across the world.

Previously bacteria were too un-nutritious to eat, but photosynthetic organisms are now worth hunting and eating. This kicks off aerobic respiration, which is more efficient.

Rather than compressing information like a black box, these models function as reversible encoders, preserving the full structure of their inputs from initialization through training. 

The implications for safety and privacy are equally significant: injectivity allows for activation-based anomaly detection to defend against adversarial attacks, but it also raises concerns about data recovery and intellectual property, since original prompts could potentially be extracted. As a result, new approaches—such as deliberately “forgetful” architectures or blockchain-style provenance tracking—may be needed to protect sensitive information. Overall, this discovery reframes language models as verifiable and interpretable systems, offering new trust and accountability in critical domains like law, healthcare, and governance, while demanding fresh ethical and regulatory safeguards." created="Thu, 30 Oct 2025 10:56:01 GMT" category="llms,audit,privacy,ip,legal" />

Berkeley neuroscientist, told me. Language is like experience pre-chewed; other kinds of data are less dense with meaning. “Why is it that we haven’t had a comparable revolution in terms of reasoning about video data?” Gershman, the Harvard cognitive scientist, asked. “The kinds of vision models that we have still struggle with common-sense reasoning about physics.” A recent model from DeepMind can generate videos in which paints are mixed correctly and mazes are solved—but they also depict a glass bouncing, instead of shattering, and ropes defying physics by being smooshed into a knot.

2.4 billion years ago, a bacterium cracks photosynthesis, setting off the Great Oxygenation Event, etc. Here’s a related timeline from another notes post:

 Life is mostly doing anaerobic respiration until this point, when some guys start making their own sugars and storing them. These guys are tasty. Previously bacteria were too un-nutritious to eat, but photosynthetic organisms are now worth hunting and eating. This kicks off aerobic respiration, which is more efficient.

Animals and fungi, the two multicellular respiratory (in this context, as opposed to photosynthetic) branches of life, chose different paths: fungi wait for sugar-containing life to die and eat through external digestion by secreting enzymes. Animals have a weird pocket for this." created="Sat, 18 Oct 2025 18:50:36 GMT" category="book,resource,intelligence,learning" />

While still crucial to the team, the role of our animators is no longer to draw animation curves, creating state transitions, or blending clips. They’re here to train agents, just like us. While engineers like myself approach it from an algorithmic perspective, they do it with an animator’s eye for detail: Does it look nice? Does it telegraph correctly? Does it look credible? Much like a choreographer, they direct the feeling and intent of the final movement, rather than moving each leg themselves.

“Introducing new procedural tools requires acceptance and a change of mindset.”

In this new workflow, our colleagues have to work at a higher level of abstraction: instead of deciding animation curves, they describe movement behaviors that the machine learning should respect. Similarly, our game designers aren’t able to decide exact movements for an agent. Instead, they provide goals and instructions that are then fulfilled by the agent based on how it was trained." created="Fri, 24 Oct 2025 11:40:24 GMT" category="ai,data-science,machine-learning" />

All of this is happening every day with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google models, too. As we look forward, the risk of model collapse - models training themselves into oblivion on their own slop - isn&apos;t that models become less useful but that they become even more fundamentally prone to support bifurcated constructed realities. All the while, for most of us, all of this is happening in a paralyzing field of uncertainty. We are faced with the choice between lacking all conviction and being full of passionate intensity. When I see a video or an image, I doubt it immediately. I feel completely ill-equipped to speak to its veracity and terrified to stake my credibility on its authenticity. More often than ever I find it necessary to ask myself what I need to be true and to challenge it. More than ever I find it hard to justify how I spend my time online against what I know that social networks are doing to the way that I think.

And I know that I&apos;m not alone." created="Wed, 15 Oct 2025 22:53:02 GMT" category="truth,grok,media,narritive" />

To compete and deter in a two-rival space environment, the U.S. Space Force (USSF) should
adopt a more proactive approach and match resilience efforts with investments in counterspace capabilities that would enable the United States to apply a deterrence-by-punishment
approach in space. Such an approach would suggest developing, exercising, and selectively
revealing space weapons. Leveraging these weapons would enable deterrence-by-punishment options and support cost imposition during both peacetime and conflict. Ultimately,
balancing resilience with a more proactive strategy that adopts a two-rival force concept
would provide the United States with a framework to strengthen U.S. freedom of action in

Here we study global dynamical patterns of communication on Twitter across many scales. Underlying the observed patterns is both the diurnal rotation of the Earth, day and night, and the synchrony required for contingency of actions between individuals. We find that urban areas show a cyclic contraction and expansion that resembles heartbeats linked to social rather than natural cycles. Different urban areas have characteristic signatures of daily collective activities. We show that the differences detected are consistent with a new emergent global synchrony that couples behaviour in distant regions across the world. Although local synchrony is the major force that shapes the collective behaviour in cities, a larger-scale synchronization is beginning to occur." created="Sat, 18 Oct 2025 14:10:45 GMT" category="human,behavior,patterns,social-media,synchrony" />

We overcome the poor signal quality plaguing prior work and build the first general parser that can handle the diverse protocols in use by heterogeneous endpoints. We found 50% of GEO links contained cleartext IP traffic; while link-layer encryption has been standard practice in satellite TV for decades, IP links typically lacked encryption at both the link and network layers. This gives us a unique view into the internal network security practices of these organizations. We observed unencrypted cellular backhaul traffic from several providers including cleartext call and text contents, job scheduling and industrial control systems for utility infrastructure, military asset tracking, " created="Tue, 14 Oct 2025 10:10:19 GMT" category="pdf,documentation" />

And so that&apos;s part of what&apos;s going on.

But hope for me has never been optimism. Optimism is &quot;everything will be fine,&quot; which invites people to kick back and wait for &quot;fine&quot; to arrive of its own accord. Hope for me is always that there are possibilities. And we have a responsibility to try to realize them, and to not realize the worst possibilities. The future is being made in the present. So hope for me is not about prophesying a future that everything will be fine. It&apos;s reminding people that we&apos;ve changed the world before, and that we can again: we know how it works.

Amazon said it does not currently use the biometric data for “model training or algorithmic purposes.”

In order to biometrically identify you, a company typically will take your image and extract a faceprint by taking tiny measurements of your face and converting that into a series of numbers that is saved for later. When you step in front of a camera again, the company takes a new faceprint and compares it to a list of previous prints to find a match. Other forms of biometric tracking can be done with a scan of your fingertip, eyeball, or even your particular gait.

Amazon has told reporters that the feature will be off by default and that it would be unavailable in certain jurisdictions with the most active biometric privacy enforcement—including the states of Illinois and Texas, and the city of Portland, Oregon. The company would not promise that this feature will remain off by default in the future." created="Mon, 10 Nov 2025 20:52:40 GMT" category="ethics,surveillance,harms,privacy" />

Rather than compressing information like a black box, these models function as reversible encoders, preserving the full structure of their inputs from initialization through training. 

The implications for safety and privacy are equally significant: injectivity allows for activation-based anomaly detection to defend against adversarial attacks, but it also raises concerns about data recovery and intellectual property, since original prompts could potentially be extracted. As a result, new approaches—such as deliberately “forgetful” architectures or blockchain-style provenance tracking—may be needed to protect sensitive information. Overall, this discovery reframes language models as verifiable and interpretable systems, offering new trust and accountability in critical domains like law, healthcare, and governance, while demanding fresh ethical and regulatory safeguards." created="Thu, 30 Oct 2025 10:56:01 GMT" category="llms,audit,privacy,ip,legal" />

Before being considered for submission to arXiv’s CS category, review articles and position papers must now be accepted at a journal or a conference and complete successful peer review. When submitting review articles or position papers, authors must include documentation of successful peer review to receive full consideration. Review/survey articles or position papers submitted to arXiv without this documentation will be likely to be rejected and not appear on arXiv.

This change is being implemented due to the unmanageable influx of review articles and position papers to arXiv CS." created="Sat, 01 Nov 2025 16:30:58 GMT" category="ethics,ai-slop,science,publishing,arXiv" />

As part of Google&apos;s ongoing efforts to define best practices for secure AI systems, we’re sharing our aspirational framework for secure AI agents. We advocate for a hybrid, defense-in-depth strategy that combines the strengths of traditional, deterministic security controls with dynamic, reasoning-based defenses. This approach is grounded in three core principles: agents must have well-defined human controllers, their powers must be carefully limited, and their actions and planning must be observable. This paper reflects our current thinking and the direction of our efforts as we work towards ensuring that AI agents can be powerful, useful, and secure by default." created="Wed, 12 Nov 2025 16:17:44 GMT" category="google,agents,security,agentic-web,agentic-systems,multi-computer-agency" />

This information consists largely of facts that people are legally obligated to tell the government. The IRS has a lot of very sensitive data about personal finances. The Treasury Department has data about any money received from the government. The Office of Personnel Management has an enormous amount of detailed information about government employees—including the very personal form required to get a security clearance. The Census Bureau possesses vast data about everyone living in the U.S., including, for example, a database of real estate ownership in the country. The Department of Defense and the Bureau of Veterans Affairs have data about present and former members of the military, the Department of Homeland Security has travel information, and various agencies possess health records.

How do we learn about them?  In most western countries, social media and video networks are now our main source of news and the way we receive updates from our friends.

They have never been great actors — Amnesty International accused Meta of platforming a genocide in Myanmar in 2017 — but their influence and power has never been greater than it is today. And every major commercial social network is complicit. They’re collaborators.  We all know about Twitter acquirer Elon Musk, who bent the platform to fit his political worldview. But he’s not alone.

Underlying the observed patterns is both the diurnal rotation of the Earth, day and night, and the synchrony required for contingency of actions between individuals. We find that urban areas show a cyclic contraction and expansion that resembles heartbeats linked to social rather than natural cycles. Different urban areas have characteristic signatures of daily collective activities. We show that the differences detected are consistent with a new emergent global synchrony that couples behaviour in distant regions across the world. Although local synchrony is the major force that shapes the collective behaviour in cities, a larger-scale synchronization is beginning to occur." created="Sat, 18 Oct 2025 14:10:45 GMT" category="human,behavior,patterns,social-media,synchrony" />

He wasn’t just tracing similarities; he was hunting for a primordial mythology, a long-lost ancestor dimly visible in its descendants. He happened to believe this original tradition was Christian truth, but set aside the apologetics and there’s still something intoxicating about the quest for a key: the notion that, by sifting through myth, we might retrieve the imaginative worlds of the earliest storytellers. Nor is the quest just a scholarly game; it’s an attempt to prove, against all odds, that our wild, warring species shares something irreducible at its core.

Nowadays, we can unearth bones, extract DNA, even map ancient migrations, but only in myths can we glimpse the inner lives of our forebears—their fears and longings, their sense of wonder and dread. Linguists have reconstructed dead languages. Why not try to do the same for lost stories? And, if we can, how far back can we go?

In order for Amazon to recognize particular people, it will need to perform face recognition on every person that steps in front of the camera. Even if a camera owner does not tag a particular face, Amazon says it may retain that biometric information for up to six months. Amazon said it does not currently use the biometric data for “model training or algorithmic purposes.”

In order to biometrically identify you, a company typically will take your image and extract a faceprint by taking tiny measurements of your face and converting that into a series of numbers that is saved for later. When you step in front of a camera again, the company takes a new faceprint and compares it to a list of previous prints to find a match. Other forms of biometric tracking can be done with a scan of your fingertip, eyeball, or even your particular gait.

Amazon has told reporters that the feature will be off by default and that it would be unavailable in certain jurisdictions with the most active biometric privacy enforcement—including the states of Illinois and Texas, and the city of Portland, Oregon.

Here we study global dynamical patterns of communication on Twitter across many scales. Underlying the observed patterns is both the diurnal rotation of the Earth, day and night, and the synchrony required for contingency of actions between individuals. We find that urban areas show a cyclic contraction and expansion that resembles heartbeats linked to social rather than natural cycles. Different urban areas have characteristic signatures of daily collective activities. We show that the differences detected are consistent with a new emergent global synchrony that couples behaviour in distant regions across the world. Although local synchrony is the major force that shapes the collective behaviour in cities, a larger-scale synchronization is beginning to occur." created="Sat, 18 Oct 2025 14:10:45 GMT" category="human,behavior,patterns,social-media,synchrony" />

Berkeley neuroscientist, told me. Language is like experience pre-chewed; other kinds of data are less dense with meaning. “Why is it that we haven’t had a comparable revolution in terms of reasoning about video data?” Gershman, the Harvard cognitive scientist, asked. “The kinds of vision models that we have still struggle with common-sense reasoning about physics.” A recent model from DeepMind can generate videos in which paints are mixed correctly and mazes are solved—but they also depict a glass bouncing, instead of shattering, and ropes defying physics by being smooshed into a knot. Ida Momennejad, a cognitive neuroscientist who now works for Microsoft Research, has done experiments in which an L.L.M. is given a virtual walk-through of a building and then asked questions about routes and shortcuts—spatial inferences that come easily to humans.

They want the only source of information of truth to be themselves, which is why they have to dismantle the deeply democratic nature of fact, truth, history, and science. And so that&apos;s part of what&apos;s going on.

But hope for me has never been optimism. Optimism is &quot;everything will be fine,&quot; which invites people to kick back and wait for &quot;fine&quot; to arrive of its own accord. Hope for me is always that there are possibilities. And we have a responsibility to try to realize them, and to not realize the worst possibilities. The future is being made in the present. So hope for me is not about prophesying a future that everything will be fine. It&apos;s reminding people that we&apos;ve changed the world before, and that we can again: we know how it works.
