If we were to simply listen to the smart voices of those who aren&apos;t lost in the hype cycle, we might see that it is not inevitable that AI systems use content without the consent of creators, and it is not impossible to build AI systems that respect commitments to environmental sustainability. We can build AI that isn&apos;t centralized under the control of a handful of giant companies. Or any other definition of &quot;good AI&quot; that people might aspire to. But instead, we end up with the worst, most anti-social approaches because the platforms that have introduced &quot;AI&quot; to the public imagination are run by authoritarian extremists with deeply destructive agendas.

Here we study global dynamical patterns of communication on Twitter across many scales. Underlying the observed patterns is both the diurnal rotation of the Earth, day and night, and the synchrony required for contingency of actions between individuals. We find that urban areas show a cyclic contraction and expansion that resembles heartbeats linked to social rather than natural cycles. Different urban areas have characteristic signatures of daily collective activities. We show that the differences detected are consistent with a new emergent global synchrony that couples behaviour in distant regions across the world. Although local synchrony is the major force that shapes the collective behaviour in cities, a larger-scale synchronization is beginning to occur." created="Sat, 18 Oct 2025 14:10:45 GMT" category="human,behavior,patterns,social-media,synchrony" />

2.4 billion years ago, a bacterium cracks photosynthesis, setting off the Great Oxygenation Event, etc. Here’s a related timeline from another notes post:

 Life is mostly doing anaerobic respiration until this point, when some guys start making their own sugars and storing them. These guys are tasty. Previously bacteria were too un-nutritious to eat, but photosynthetic organisms are now worth hunting and eating. This kicks off aerobic respiration, which is more efficient.

Animals and fungi, the two multicellular respiratory (in this context, as opposed to photosynthetic) branches of life, chose different paths: fungi wait for sugar-containing life to die and eat through external digestion by secreting enzymes. Animals have a weird pocket for this." created="Sat, 18 Oct 2025 18:50:36 GMT" category="book,resource,intelligence,learning" />

We present DeepSeek-OCR as an initial investigation into the feasibility of compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping. DeepSeek-OCR consists of two components: Deep Encoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder. Specifically, DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a compression ratio &lt; 10x), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of 97%. Even at a compression ratio of 20x, the OCR accuracy still remains at about 60%. This shows considerable promise for research areas such as historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs. Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value.
On OmniDoBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 (6000+ tokens per page on average) while utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens. In production, DeepSeek-OCR can generate training data for LLMs/VLMs at a scale of 200k+ pages per day (a single A100-40G).

We overcome the poor signal quality plaguing prior work and build the first general parser that can handle the diverse protocols in use by heterogeneous endpoints. We found 50% of GEO links contained cleartext IP traffic; while link-layer encryption has been standard practice in satellite TV for decades, IP links typically lacked encryption at both the link and network layers. This gives us a unique view into the internal network security practices of these organizations. We observed unencrypted cellular backhaul traffic from several providers including cleartext call and text contents, job scheduling and industrial control systems for utility infrastructure, military asset tracking, " created="Tue, 14 Oct 2025 10:10:19 GMT" category="pdf,documentation" />

But instead, we end up with the worst, most anti-social approaches because the platforms that have introduced &quot;AI&quot; to the public imagination are run by authoritarian extremists with deeply destructive agendas.

How do we learn about them?  In most western countries, social media and video networks are now our main source of news and the way we receive updates from our friends. A handful of companies own how we learn about the world, giving them the ability to shape our collective worldviews, influence movements, and prioritize their own interests. 

They have never been great actors — Amnesty International accused Meta of platforming a genocide in Myanmar in 2017 — but their influence and power has never been greater than it is today. And every major commercial social network is complicit. They’re collaborators.  We all know about Twitter acquirer Elon Musk, who bent the platform to fit his political worldview. But he’s not alone.
Here’s Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, owner of LinkedIn, who contributed a million dollars to Trump’s inauguration fund.
Here’s Mark Zuckerberg, who owns Threads, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, who said that he feels optimistic about the new administration’s agenda. And here’s Larry Ellison, who will control TikTok in the US, who was a major investor in Trump, and who one advisor called, in a WIRED interview, the shadow President of the United States. Social media is very quickly becoming aligned with a state that in itself is becoming increasingly authoritarian." created="Sun, 19 Oct 2025 09:59:03 GMT" category="ethics,social-media,open-social" />

Underlying the observed patterns is both the diurnal rotation of the Earth, day and night, and the synchrony required for contingency of actions between individuals. We find that urban areas show a cyclic contraction and expansion that resembles heartbeats linked to social rather than natural cycles. Different urban areas have characteristic signatures of daily collective activities. We show that the differences detected are consistent with a new emergent global synchrony that couples behaviour in distant regions across the world. Although local synchrony is the major force that shapes the collective behaviour in cities, a larger-scale synchronization is beginning to occur." created="Sat, 18 Oct 2025 14:10:45 GMT" category="human,behavior,patterns,social-media,synchrony" />

If we were to simply listen to the smart voices of those who aren&apos;t lost in the hype cycle, we might see that it is not inevitable that AI systems use content without the consent of creators, and it is not impossible to build AI systems that respect commitments to environmental sustainability. We can build AI that isn&apos;t centralized under the control of a handful of giant companies. Or any other definition of &quot;good AI&quot; that people might aspire to. But instead, we end up with the worst, most anti-social approaches because the platforms that have introduced &quot;AI&quot; to the public imagination are run by authoritarian extremists with deeply destructive agendas.

Here we study global dynamical patterns of communication on Twitter across many scales. Underlying the observed patterns is both the diurnal rotation of the Earth, day and night, and the synchrony required for contingency of actions between individuals. We find that urban areas show a cyclic contraction and expansion that resembles heartbeats linked to social rather than natural cycles. Different urban areas have characteristic signatures of daily collective activities. We show that the differences detected are consistent with a new emergent global synchrony that couples behaviour in distant regions across the world. Although local synchrony is the major force that shapes the collective behaviour in cities, a larger-scale synchronization is beginning to occur." created="Sat, 18 Oct 2025 14:10:45 GMT" category="human,behavior,patterns,social-media,synchrony" />

We perform the first broad scan of IP traffic on 39 GEO satellites across 25 distinct longitudes with 411 transponders using consumergrade equipment. We overcome the poor signal quality plaguing prior work and build the first general parser that can handle the diverse protocols in use by heterogeneous endpoints. We found 50% of GEO links contained cleartext IP traffic; while link-layer encryption has been standard practice in satellite TV for decades, IP links typically lacked encryption at both the link and network layers. This gives us a unique view into the internal network security practices of these organizations. We observed unencrypted cellular backhaul traffic from several providers including cleartext call and text contents, job scheduling and industrial control systems for utility infrastructure, military asset tracking, " created="Tue, 14 Oct 2025 10:10:19 GMT" category="pdf,documentation" />

 Life is mostly doing anaerobic respiration until this point, when some guys start making their own sugars and storing them. These guys are tasty. Previously bacteria were too un-nutritious to eat, but photosynthetic organisms are now worth hunting and eating. This kicks off aerobic respiration, which is more efficient.

Animals and fungi, the two multicellular respiratory (in this context, as opposed to photosynthetic) branches of life, chose different paths: fungi wait for sugar-containing life to die and eat through external digestion by secreting enzymes.

The Treasury Department has data about any money received from the government. The Office of Personnel Management has an enormous amount of detailed information about government employees—including the very personal form required to get a security clearance. The Census Bureau possesses vast data about everyone living in the U.S., including, for example, a database of real estate ownership in the country. The Department of Defense and the Bureau of Veterans Affairs have data about present and former members of the military, the Department of Homeland Security has travel information, and various agencies possess health records.

How do we learn about them?  In most western countries, social media and video networks are now our main source of news and the way we receive updates from our friends. A handful of companies own how we learn about the world, giving them the ability to shape our collective worldviews, influence movements, and prioritize their own interests. 

They have never been great actors — Amnesty International accused Meta of platforming a genocide in Myanmar in 2017 — but their influence and power has never been greater than it is today. And every major commercial social network is complicit. They’re collaborators.  We all know about Twitter acquirer Elon Musk, who bent the platform to fit his political worldview. But he’s not alone.
Here’s Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, owner of LinkedIn, who contributed a million dollars to Trump’s inauguration fund.
Here’s Mark Zuckerberg, who owns Threads, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, who said that he feels optimistic about the new administration’s agenda.

He wasn’t just tracing similarities; he was hunting for a primordial mythology, a long-lost ancestor dimly visible in its descendants. He happened to believe this original tradition was Christian truth, but set aside the apologetics and there’s still something intoxicating about the quest for a key: the notion that, by sifting through myth, we might retrieve the imaginative worlds of the earliest storytellers. Nor is the quest just a scholarly game; it’s an attempt to prove, against all odds, that our wild, warring species shares something irreducible at its core.

Nowadays, we can unearth bones, extract DNA, even map ancient migrations, but only in myths can we glimpse the inner lives of our forebears—their fears and longings, their sense of wonder and dread. Linguists have reconstructed dead languages. Why not try to do the same for lost stories? And, if we can, how far back can we go? Could we finally recover the legends of our earliest common ancestors—the ur-myths that Casaubon so desperately pursued?" created="Sat, 18 Oct 2025 18:52:46 GMT" category="stories" />

The difference is that in China, these companies operate with far less transparency.

All of this is happening every day with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google models, too. As we look forward, the risk of model collapse - models training themselves into oblivion on their own slop - isn&apos;t that models become less useful but that they become even more fundamentally prone to support bifurcated constructed realities. All the while, for most of us, all of this is happening in a paralyzing field of uncertainty. We are faced with the choice between lacking all conviction and being full of passionate intensity. When I see a video or an image, I doubt it immediately. I feel completely ill-equipped to speak to its veracity and terrified to stake my credibility on its authenticity. More often than ever I find it necessary to ask myself what I need to be true and to challenge it.

This information consists largely of facts that people are legally obligated to tell the government. The IRS has a lot of very sensitive data about personal finances. The Treasury Department has data about any money received from the government. The Office of Personnel Management has an enormous amount of detailed information about government employees—including the very personal form required to get a security clearance. The Census Bureau possesses vast data about everyone living in the U.S., including, for example, a database of real estate ownership in the country. The Department of Defense and the Bureau of Veterans Affairs have data about present and former members of the military, the Department of Homeland Security has travel information, and various agencies possess health records.
