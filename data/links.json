      "pullQuote": "LeCun calls Wang, who was hired to lead the organisation, “young” and “inexperienced”.\n\n“He learns fast, he knows what he doesn’t know . . . There’s no experience with research or how you practise research, how you do it. Or what would be attractive or repulsive to a researcher.”\n\nWang also became LeCun’s manager. I ask LeCun how he felt about this shift in hierarchy. He initially brushes it off, saying he’s used to working with young people. “The average age of a Facebook engineer at the time was 27. I was twice the age of the average engineer.”\n\nBut those 27-year-olds weren’t telling him what to do, I point out.\n\n“Alex [Wang] isn’t telling me what to do either,” he says. “You don’t tell a researcher what to do. You certainly don’t tell a researcher like me what to do.”\n",
