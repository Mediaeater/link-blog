Please don’t feel sad for me. I’ve had a life filled with love, great experiences and wonderful career opportunities. Despite my demise at a relatively young age, I consider myself beyond fortunate.\n\n",

      "pullQuote": "So far, the company hasn’t spent any money on marketing for its shows and only relies on in-platform searches. She said Apple Podcasts, Spotify and other platforms mostly just encourage people to disclose when they use AI, which she said the company does. (I saw disclosures in some shows, but not all, which we’ll get into below.)\n\n“To make another bold prediction, I think that within the next 12 months, certainly 24 months, I think AI becomes the default way that people are making content,” Wright said. “And so we will move away from having a disclosure the same way that you don’t disclose that a movie is made with CGI.”",
